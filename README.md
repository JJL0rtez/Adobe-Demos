## Flash Programming
The Flash program included is a basic matching game where the player needs to identify 3 different road signs.
The program will give feedback based on the correctness of the player's choices.

I have included the flash files so the code can be rewiewed if needed.

### Vision Document
The following is short version of a vision document.

#### Required Features:
1. Must allow users to match 3 or more items
2. Must have a basic title screen with a basic animation
3. Gives feedback to user based on correctness of answers
4. Allows the user to restart the program at any time.

#### Time requirements
No cost requirements as this is a project done on personal time for personal use.
1. Main menu and navigation
   30 minutes.
2. Create and/or repurpose sign icons.
   1 hour (can be less if previously made PS files are used)
3. Code main game mechanics
   2 hours
4. Code restart mechanic
   10 minutes

## Photoshop
The image files are part of a "map" pack for a Minecraft server that I donate my time to through development and administration work.

Each map is required to be a 128x128 pixel PNG image, and when added to the server, allows the players to use these images as they build things in-game.

To create these images, I would find a reference online and then make the best representation I could within the very restricted image size.

The final deployment of this project is ongoing but will contain more than 1000 images for the players to enjoy. I have included a few batches of some of the maps.
